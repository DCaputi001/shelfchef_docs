        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Modern home cooks are overwhelmed with recipe inspiration. Cookbooks,
            social media, video platforms, and food blogs provide endless ideas.
            However, translating inspiration into action remains difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core friction occurs between seeing a recipe and actually cooking it.
            Users often lack visibility into what ingredients they already own,
            overbuy at grocery stores, and let food expire unused. Recipes live in
            fragmented locations, and grocery planning is disconnected from pantry awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result is wasted food, wasted money, and fewer home-cooked meals.
        </p>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Busy home cooks</strong> who cook multiple times per week and want efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Budget-conscious households</strong> seeking to reduce grocery spending and food waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking enthusiasts</strong> who collect recipes from multiple sources and want organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These users value convenience, clarity, and tools that reduce friction
            between inspiration and execution.

        <h2>Competitive Advantage</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional recipe apps that focus only on discovery,
            ShelfChef connects the full lifecycle of cooking:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pantry awareness</li>
            <li>Recipe management</li>
            <li>Grocery planning</li>
            <li>AI-assisted decision support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The integration of structured web scraping with AI fallback ensures
            higher reliability in recipe importing. The “What Can I Cook?” feature
            transforms pantry data into actionable cooking decisions.

        <h2>Monetization Strategy</h2>

        <p>
            ShelfChef follows a freemium subscription model powered by RevenueCat.
            The free tier provides real value while introducing natural upgrade triggers.
        </p>

        <h3>Free Tier Includes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlimited pantry management</li>
            <li>Unlimited grocery lists</li>
            <li>Up to 10 saved recipes</li>
            <li>Up to 5 URL imports</li>
            <li>Multi-timer functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pro Tier Unlocks:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unlimited recipes and imports</li>
            <li>AI-powered smart recipe suggestions</li>
            <li>Recipe scaling</li>

            and lifetime purchase. This structure accommodates different commitment levels
            while encouraging long-term retention.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
        <h2>Why This Model Works</h2>
        <p>
            The free tier is genuinely useful, encouraging habit formation.
            As users save more recipes and rely on pantry tracking,
            upgrade prompts feel natural rather than forced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once users build inventory data and recipe collections,
            switching costs increase, supporting long-term retention.
